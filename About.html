                    I grew up loving history and law. By 5 years old I had memorized the entire Constitution and all the Presidents in order by middle 
                    name and height. All through growing up my desire for all things history and law became such a burning in me that I had to follow it's calling. 
                    As a result I knew I had to become a lawyer. Plus because of my big ears I knew that I had to make something of my life to stop being made fun of.
                    Plus I thought suing people sounded fun and a way to get back at people. So I breezed through Law School and started this firm.
                    But I am here to fight for your rights at whatever the cost is. I know it's a difficult world out there. I know there a lot of jerks that want to
                    take advantage of you. But I'm here to protect you from those jerks.

                        So why don't you just sit back and relax and let me serve you in any legal help that you might need. I have extensive wisdom
                        and knowledge in many diverse areas that will allow you to sue whoever or whatever your heart desires! I have been the lead 
                        employment lawyer for global security company with 50,000+ employees and $2 billion+ revenue in the United States. I have also
                        been delivering actionable and practical legal advice to C-level executives and other management, HR professionals and field 
                        operations on a range of day-to-day labor and employment matters including: recruiting and hiring practices; employee performance 
                        management; leaves of absence; workplace accommodations; wage and hour compliance; compensation plans; separation agreements; 
                        non-compete, non-solicit and other restrictive covenant agreements; internal investigations; and investigations by government agencies.

                    What does all that mean? It means I'm a pretty smart guy. But let me put something into terms that you will understand. This past Spring
                    I had the opportunity to go head to head against ISIS. ISIS? You mean some law firm with the initials of I.S.I.S? No, I'm talking about
                    THE <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant" target="blank">ISIS</a>. I could tell you more about it
                    but I want you around as a client so I can't say too much. But the company that I used to work for thought that I was Chuck Norris enough
                    to go after those vigilantes so they selected me. So if you want a lawyer that has a resume of just fighting for your rights in
                    a boring court room then feel free to go somewhere else. But if you want an internationl fighter, someone who has taken on one of the most
                    difficult terrorist cells ever known, then I'm definitely your man. Plus, my oldest daughter has developed the mouth of a sailor so that's 
                    helped me in the court room to handle that type of language. Oh, plus I got some pretty impressive credentials.
